<p>For fusion energy to be viable, reactors need to become more stable. Currently, reactors are not able to sustain a reaction for a long enough time for fusion to be commercially viable. A way to keep the cost down is also required for fusion to take over the energy market.</p>
<p>Scientists are going to have to research fusion energy more to get a better understanding of how it works and how to make it safer.</p>
